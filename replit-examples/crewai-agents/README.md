# CrewAI Machine Learning Assistant

## Overview

The CrewAI Machine Learning Assistant is a command line application designed to kickstart your machine learning projects. It leverages a team of AI agents to guide you through the initial steps of defining, assessing, and solving machine learning problems.

## Features

- **Problem Definition**: Clarify the machine learning problem you want to solve, identifying the type of problem (e.g., classification, regression) and any specific requirements.

- **Data Assessment**: Evaluate the data provided by the user, assessing its quality, suitability for the problem, and suggesting preprocessing steps if necessary.

- **Model Recommendation**: Suggest the most suitable machine learning models based on the problem definition and data assessment, providing reasons for each recommendation.

- **Starter Code Generation**: Generate starter Python code for the project, including data loading, model definition, and a basic training loop, based on findings from the problem definitions, data assessment, and model recommendation.

## Usage

You can [fork and run this application on Replit](https://replit.com/@GroqCloud/CrewAI-Machine-Learning-Assistant) or run it on the command line with `python main.py`. The application will output a Markdown file including python code for your ML use case to the same directory as main.py.
