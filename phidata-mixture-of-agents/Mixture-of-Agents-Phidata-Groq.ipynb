    "In our project, multiple MLB Writer agents, each utilizing a different language model (`llama3-70b-8192`, `llama3-8b-8192`, `gemma2-9b-it`, and `mixtral-8x7b-32768`), will independently generate game recap articles based on game data collected from other Phidata Assistants. These diverse outputs will then be aggregated by an MLB Editor agent, which will synthesize the best elements from each article to create a final, polished game recap. This process not only demonstrates the power of collaborative AI but also highlights the effectiveness of integrating multiple models to enhance the quality of the generated content."

    "**Problem:** We need to turn general-purpose LLMs into specialized assistants for our use-case.\n",

    "**Solution:** Extend LLMs with memory, knowledge and tools:\n",
    "- **Memory:** Stores **chat history** in a database and enables LLMs to have long-term conversations.\n",
    "- **Knowledge:** Stores information in a vector database and provides LLMs with **business context**.\n",
    "- **Tools:** Enable LLMs to **take actions** like pulling data from an API, sending emails or querying a database.\n",

Clay Holmes struggled in the sixth, allowing two hits and three runs, although none were earned.\n",

    "We use multiple MLB Writer agents utilizing different language models to independently generate game recap articles based on game data collected from other Phidata Assistants. An MLB Editor agent then synthesizes the best elements from each article to create a final, polished game recap.\n",
