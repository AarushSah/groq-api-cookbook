    "Since the dawn of the Electronic Health Record, deriving meaningful insights about the social determinants of health of a patient population has been the holy grail of healthcare analytics. While discrete clinical data (vitals, lab results, diagnoses, etc) is well understood, social determinants - things like financial insecurity, which can determine patient outcomes and barriers to care as much as the patient's clinical chart - are often hidden in clinical notes and unused by analytics departments. While some providers code social determinants using Z codes, this is often too inconsistent and many risk models seeking to add a social determinant score will simply default to using zip code as a crude proxy. With the emergence of Large Language Models, AI has the ability to extract and structure meaningful insights from free-text clinical notes at scale, enabling more effective patient outreach, better risk modeling and a more robust understanding of a patient population as a whole."

    "This notebook shows how we can use Groq's new [JSON mode](https://console.groq.com/docs/text-chat#json-mode-object-object) feature to extract social determinants of health from fake clinical notes, structure them into a neat table that can be used for analytics and load them into BigQuery. We will read in each note, ask the LLM to determine if certain social determinant features are met, output structured data and load it into a database to be incorporated with the rest of our clinical data marts."

       "\n",
       "**History of Present Illness:** The patient is a 42-year-old who presents with a 3-week history of increased fatigue, decreased energy, and occasional headaches. The patient reports struggling with sleep due to stress from work and personal life. The patient is currently working two part-time jobs but still finds it hard to make ends meet, indicating financial stress. They express concern over the cost of medications and healthcare visits.\n",

       "The patient juggles two jobs to make ends meet, one at a local retail store and another in a fast-food chain, neither offering full-time hours or benefits. Despite the long hours, the patient mentions financial difficulties, especially with covering rent and providing. They share an apartment with three others in an area described as 'not the safest,' due to recent break-ins and a noticeable police presence. Meals are often missed or minimal, as the patient tries to stretch their budget, sometimes seeking help from local food banks when things get particularly tight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Educationally, the patient completed high school but hasn't pursued further studies, citing lack of funds and the immediate need to support their family after graduation. They rely on buses and trains for transportation, which complicates timely access to healthcare, often causing delays or missed appointments. Socially, the patient admits to feeling isolated, with most of their family living out of state after their divorce and a personal life that has been 'on hold' due to work and financial pressures. They have a basic health insurance plan with high co-payments, which has led to skipping some recommended medical tests and treatments.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Assessment/Plan:**\n",
       "- Continue to monitor blood pressure and diabetes control.\n",
       "- Discuss affordable medication options with a pharmacist.\n",
       "- Refer to a social worker to address food security, housing concerns, and access to healthcare services.\n",

       "- Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen.\n",

    "In this notebook, we've used Groq's JSON mode to extract social determinants of health from and structure them in a relational table, then loaded the results into BigQuery where they can be combined and analyzed with the rest of our patient data. With our social determinants of health now structured in our clinical data warehouse, our analytics team can use it in countless ways by delivering much-needed SDOH insights and enhancing risk models. This allows the clinical practice to not just identify high-risk patients in their population, but to implement more targeted interventions by better understanding their barriers to care.\n",
